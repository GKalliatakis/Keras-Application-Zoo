# Keras | Application Zoo - DIY Deep Learning for Vision


## You have just found Keras Application Zoo

Keras Application Zoo is a public clearinghouse for [Keras Applications](https://keras.io/applications/)- compatible models to promote progress and reproduce research.

Lots of researchers and engineers have made their deep learning models public in various frameworks for different tasks with all kinds of architectures and data. These models are learned and applied for problems ranging from simple regression, to large-scale visual classification. 

However, [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) does not contain the degree of pre-trained models that come complete with [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). 


To lower the friction of sharing these models, we introduce the Keras Application Zoo:

- A central GitHub repo for sharing popular deep learning models with **Keras code & weights files**
- Contains **ONLY additional** deep learning models which are **not yet available within `keras.applications` module itself**
- Tools to upload/download model info to/from Github, and to download trained Keras Applications-compatible binaries
- Models can be used for prediction, feature extraction, and fine-tuning just like the default `keras.applications` models.
- No separate models configuration files in a declarative format. Models are described in Python code, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility.

**Benefit from networks that you could not practically train yourself by taking Keras to the Zoo !**
